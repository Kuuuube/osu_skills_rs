//! Provides functions that don't have a numerical solution and must

/// evaluates a polynomial at `z` where `coeff` are the coeffecients
/// to a polynomial of order `k` where `k` is the length of `coeff` and the
/// coeffecient
/// to the `k`th power is the `k`th element in coeff. E.g. [3,-1,2] equates to
/// `2z^2 - z + 3`

/// Returns 0 for a 0 length coefficient slice
